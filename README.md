## [Enhanced_ADS](./Enhanced_ADS/) 
[Steam Workshop (tested on Duckov v1.1.6)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/itemedittext/?id=3600556258)

During ADS or scoped view, the camera is positioned directly at the aiming point.  
Until the aiming point goes off-screen, it behaves the same as hip fire.
